## Know the version and build

Run in PowerShell:
```powershell
# Displays the version in a window 
winver

# Displays the version in the terminal
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"
```

## Know the domain

Run in PowerShell either of the two:
```powershell
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"Domain"
wmic computersystem get domain
```

## Know whether a service is running on a port number

Run in PowerShell:
```powershell
netstat -an -b | grep <port_number>
```

## Create a EXT4 partition

Run in PowerShell:
```powershell
choco install partitionwizard ext2fsd -y
```

Use MiniTool Partition Wizard to create a EXT4 partition.
[Ext2Fsd](http://www.ext2fsd.com/) adds EXT4 support to Windows.

## Change the screenshots default save location

1. Right click on `%USERPROFILE%\Pictures\Screenshots\`

1. Properties > Location

## Create your own custom keyboard layout

- [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339)

## Wipe all the deleted data / free space on a drive

```powershell
# Overwrites the deallocated space on drive C:
cipher /w:C
```

Cipher goes through the following steps:

1. creates the folder `C:\EFSTMPWP`

1. creates a first file in that folder filled with `0`, making it grow until the hard drive fills up

1. deletes that file and creates a second one filled with `255`, making it grow until the hard drive fills up

1. deletes the second file, creates a third file filled with random numbers, making it grow until the hard drive fills up again

1. deletes the third file and returns you to the prompt

## See the command history across all PowerShell sessions

```powershell
cat (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath
``` 

## Lock a BitLocker encrypted drive from the command line

```powershell
manage-bde.exe -lock e:
```

## Find a file or directory being used by another process

1. Open "Resource Monitor" (`resmon.exe`)
1. Go to the "CPU" tab
1. In the "Associated Handles" section, type part of the file or directory name in the search box

## Autostarting programs locations

- Task Manager > Startup apps

- Registry Editor:

   - `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

   - `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

- Task Scheduler > Task Scheduler Library

## Install the latest Windows release with all the latest updates included

1. Download the image creation script from [UUP dump](https://uupdump.net/)

1. Set `CustomList=1` in `ConvertConfig.ini` in order to avoid including Windows bloatware (like Outlook, Teams, Xbox, etc) in the installation image.

1. Run `uup_download_windows.cmd`

The process will take a while: it takes 35 minutes on a beafy desktop computer with a 150 Mbps bandwidth. Once it's done, you'll find the ISO image (~6 GB) in the folder where you ran the script. You can use it to create a bootable USB drive with [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/).

## Get rid of US language in Windows 11

In Windows 11 settings (`Win`+`i`), select _Time & language_ > _Language & region_:

1. _Related settings_ section, _Administrative language settings_ option, _Administrative_ tab, _Language for non-Unicode programs_ > press the _Change system locale..._ button, replace _US English_ with the layout of your main language.

1. Reboot.
